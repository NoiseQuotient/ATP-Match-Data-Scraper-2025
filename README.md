# ATP Match Data Scraper 2025
This project scrapes detailed tennis match data for the 2025 ATP Tour, including scores, stats, head-to-head records, and metadata (tournament, round, surface, etc.) from the official [ATP Tour website](https://www.atptour.com). It uses **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup** to extract structured data and saves it to an Excel file for further analysis or modeling.
